# Flyout

Flyout is a World of Warcraft Vanilla (1.12) addon that mimicks the flyout feature implemented in later expansions. Using a macro you can create a flyout action button that groups together various spells.

## How to

1. Open your macros and create a new macro
2. In the macro body, start by typing `/flyout` and then the names of spells or macros separated by a semicolon

   - To use a specific rank, you can write `Frostbolt(Rank 1)` (omitting the rank will use the highest available)
   - **Do not insert a semicolon at the end of the macro!**

3. Drag the newly created macro to one of your action bars and you're good to go
